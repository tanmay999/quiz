# tannyquiz 
#This is a simple quiz application in java having dynamic background .Purely made for playing pupose .
It has a labeled question with four options which are all Radiobuttons(jRadiobutton1,jRadiobutton2,jRadiobutton3,jRadiobutton4)respectively  .Out of this four
option one is to be chosen which  if is  correct ,slides to next question .The points also gets increased by 100.
giving wrong answer  leads to loosing the game and takes to another slide having two options .
<1>restart-restarts the game
<2>quit-terminates the application
In this application their has been also the use of multithreading (in java) for the backround slideshow which makes it look even more 
cooler quiz game.
